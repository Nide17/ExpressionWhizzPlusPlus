 * Parameters:
 *   tree     The tree
 *   buf      The buffer
 *   buf_sz   Size of buffer, in bytes
 *
 * If it takes more characters to represent tree than are allowed in
 * buf, this function places as many characters as will fit into buf,

 * Buf will always be terminated with a \0 and in no case will this
